# TouchDesignerVisuals

All visuals should be able to run without any external downloads. Any common blocks that are used are stored in the tox folder. Not all of these are custom, links to their creators can be found in the description of their respective videos. The below video demos are of version one for all visuals, some may be updated down the road. The current version of each visual is indicated by the number postfix.
